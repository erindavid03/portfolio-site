      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h2>Hi there! Im Erin {':)'}</h2>
      <p>I am a Front-End Web Developer from the lower mainland with a passion for designing original creations. Whether it be a website or an art piece, I ensure that all my work is thoughtful, creative, and polished!

Since I grew up around the time that the internet was in its heyday, a lot of my inspiration comes from early 2000s nostalgia and modern-day aesthetics. After gaining an in-depth understanding of the best practices in UX/UI Design and Web Development, it is a personal goal for me to create sites that are pleasing to look at, and take you back to the joys of growing up with the internet!

When I am not around my computer, I enjoy doodling away in my sketchbooks while spinning my favourite records from my collection! Either that or Iâ€™m plotting my next plan for world domination with my army of burnt toast {'>:D'}
